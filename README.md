# Scheduling of Patrols Within the UPLB Campus Using an Opportunistic Crime Security Game
Authors: Karl Jasson B. Pios and Jaderick P. Pabico

UPLB’s security firm, the University Police Force, is tasked with protecting property and ensuring safety of the public inside campus. Patrols are deployed within campus in an effort to maintain order and deter crime, but traditional methods are prone to inefficiency and predictability. This study aims to utilize game theory as an aid in deploying patrol units. Patrols movement must be effective without creating predictable patterns. With the use of weighted probabilities, randomization, and historical data, the UPF will be capable of scheduling optimal patrols with limited resources, while avoiding predictability at the same time. Historical data will be used to determine which areas of the campus have higher priority for patrolling. The system must also be able to deploy the patrols such that adversaries find it hard to predict their next move. Upon deploying patrols to areas, the scheduling program must take into account the distance that each patrol has travelled. This scheduling approach is seen to be more efficient and robust in scheduling patrols than other traditional methods, such as pure randomization. The scheduling system is capable of maximizing patrol coverage amidst the limitations on personnel numbers, and remain resilient against predictability
